              I taught Omid at LearningFuze, where he learned full stack
              development with React, Node, and PostgreSQL, using TypeScript.
              This was an intense course that required Omid to write a full
              stack application on his own.
            </p>
            <p className="text-left mx-2 text-lg mb-4">
              At LearningFuze, Omid developed his sense for writing software. He
              studied hard, asked probing and insightful questions, worked his
              way over hurdles he faced, and became a solid developer. For his
              final project, Omid wrote an app to help people learn more about
              sports betting. Omid learned, on his own, several technologies for
              this, such as Tailwind, money input/output, and open source React
              components. He also had to analyze several APIs to find the
              information he wanted, and process those API results to adapt them
              to his needs.
            </p>
            <p className="text-left mx-2 text-lg mb-4">
              Omid was a good student who developed a good understanding of how
              software works, how to write good, clean code, and how to design
              and organize the code to make it easy to work with. He has a solid
              grasp of basic data structures and complexity analysis and how to
              use them to solve common software problems. Omid has an
              outstanding work ethic and strives to always do his best work. I
              was impressed with how hard Omid worked to make sure he understood
              the material correctly.
            </p>
            <p className="text-left mx-2 text-lg">
              As a former Director of Engineering at Google, I can say with
              confidence that Omid will be an asset to any team he joins.
